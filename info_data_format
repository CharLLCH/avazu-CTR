train-Training set of 10 days of click-through data,ordered chronologically.
test-Test set of 1 day of ads to for testing your model predictions.
Data fields:
id:ad identifier
click:0/1 for non-click/click
hour:format is YYMMDDHH,so 14091123 means 23:00 on Sept. 11 2014
columns 1-4,20-24:anonymized variables
columns 5-19:named variables
Evaluation:
Submissions are eveluated using the Logarithmic Loss(smaller is better)
Submission Format:
id of production , predicted of the probability
id , click

Logarithmic Loss (Logloss)
LogLoss =$-\frac{1}{n}\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} [y_{i}\log y_{i}{'} + (1-y_{i})\log (1-y_{i}^{'})]$

python:
import scipy as sp
def LogLossFun(act,pred):
	epsilon = 1e-15
	pred = sp.maximum(epsilon,pred)
	pred = sp.minimum(1-epsilon,pred)
	LogLoss = sum(act * sp.log(pred) + sp.subtract(1,act) * sp.log(sp.subtract(1,pred)))
	LogLoss = LogLoss * -1.0/len(act)
	return LogLoss
